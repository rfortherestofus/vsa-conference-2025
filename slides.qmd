# What is R? {.inverse}

## It's Not Just a Tool for Complicated Statistics {.inverse}

---

**What I tell people who just want the basics:**

- R is a high-powered Excel

. . .

**What I really want to say:**

- R is a tool that can completely revolutionize how you work with data

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
penguins <- read_csv("penguins.csv")
```

. . .

```{r}
penguins |>
  select(species:bill_length_mm)
```

---


```{r}
#| echo: true
penguins |>
  summarize(
    avg_bill_length = mean(
      bill_length_mm,
      na.rm = TRUE
    )

```{r}
#| echo: true

      bill_length_mm,

# Example: Automated Analysis & Reporting {.inverse}

Lincoln Park Zoo's Guest Experience Dashboard

[![](assets/gex-db-screenshot.png)](http://production.lpzoo.org/production.lpzoo.org/data/gex-dashboard.html)

## How does this work?

- Each day, responses are pulled from Alchemer (survey platform)
- R is used to clean & organize data, analyze it, create visualizations
- Rendered into report via Quarto
- Uploaded to zoo server for online viewing

### How does this run automatically?

- Windows Task Scheduler
- On Mac/Linux, chron jobs (via command line)

![](assets/task-scheduler.png)


## Time Investment

- Creating this dashboard has been a 2-year project
- Most of the work was done in about 7 months
- Later specialized improvements took about 4 months
- In between, lots of small tweaks, updates, and bug fixes

### Lines of code going into the dashboard

```{r}
# lines of code that go into the gex dashboard
library(tidyverse)
tribble(
  ~desc,
  ~lines,
  "Creating the dashboard itself",
  3483,
  "Helper functions",
  257,
  "Organizing & analyzing core survey data",
  1107,
  "Specialized map visualizations",
  222,
  "Custom visual of favorite animals",
  100,
  "Specialized free response text analysis",
  172,
  "Secondary survey data import",
  153
) |>
  arrange(lines) |>
  mutate(desc = fct(desc)) |>
  ggplot(aes(y = desc, x = lines, label = lines)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(hjust = -0.5) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    text = element_text(size = 20)
  ) +
  expand_limits(x = c(0, 4000))
```

## This is too difficult!

- Before, I had to repeat my work over and over
- Now, everything I do builds on what I've done before
- Allows me to gradually expand complexity, with a solid foundation (instead of rebuilding the foundation each time)

## What does it look like to start small?

- Remember that survey you took at the beginning...

# Demo {.inverse}

## What did this show?

- Directly importing raw data
- Cleaning, organizing, and transforming data
- Quickly grouping & summarizing datasets
- Many flexible visualizations
- Write code once, and re-run/modify as needed
- Things that are very difficult with other tools, can be much easier with R

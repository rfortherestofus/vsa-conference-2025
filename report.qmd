```{r packages}
# These are all of the packages (collections of R functions) that are used to create this report
# These are separately installed with install.packages() & need to be enabled here using the library() function

# The tidyverse package (actually, a collection of packages) is a broad set of functions for organizing, analyzing, and visualizing data
# Tidyverse packages assume that your data is in a particular format-- but this allows them to work seamlessly together
# This will often provide the vast majority of additional capability that you'll need for any project
library(tidyverse)

# This allows you to smoothly authenticate with Google and download data from Google Sheets
library(googlesheets4)

# This provides a clean_names function that makes variables easier to work with from imported data
library(janitor)


```

```{r import}
# The first step is to import the survey responses from Google Sheets
# Here's the link to add new responses to the survey: https://forms.gle/1BRREmqWbVB6x8nm9

# Authenticating with Google is necessary before downloading data from Sheets
gs4_auth("banjaloupe@gmail.com")

# This gets the responses from the Google Sheet, and saves it with the name "responses"
responses <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fL0_iM95kR2YU6om8ZE6yk_2ufp9W4RdR35gVxvi9Q8/")

# This cleans up the variable names that came in from Sheets, to make them easier to work with later
responses <- clean_names(responses)
```
